# Homework1

Initially in Homework 1 in the README all I had was “ Homework1”. Nothing more. It was not apparent to me at the time the significance of the read me. It wasn't quite clear what it was for. Now its clear to me that the README is  a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about. Maybe instructions or expanded information that you cannot just gain from looking at lines of code. Lines of codes are for the computer but the read me is for the humans that will be reading and implementing the code into other works. 

My new README

For this assignment,  I have updated the <title> tag to be more descriptive of what the site is promoting. Line 7 went from <Title>Homework<Title>  to  <Title>Horiseon<Title>.

My next update to the homework assignment was to address the image elements and just going back and making sure they each individually had alt attributes. Specifically lines  54, 6, 68 got the added alt attributes. 
Line 54 alt= “Arrow pointing down to a money symbol indicating lead-generating results in money.” 
Line 64 alt= “light bulb with sound waves indicating ideas getting advertised.”
Line 68 alt= “ Money symbol  with moving gears saving money.”

Additionally, the navbar buttons were not previously addressed. To fix and make the nav buttons functional.  We use href="#" for test links. In a real website, this would be URLs. So to proceed, I removed the # from in front f the URLs to make them functional links. Also added the path from assest to lines 16, 19, 22 so the links would work rather than be dead links ans give error messages.
